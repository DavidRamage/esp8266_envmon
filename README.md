# esp8266_envmon
Environmental monitoring using ESP8266 and SNMP
The goal of this project is to implement enough of a subset of SNMP to allow standard NMSs to monitor environmental
conditions using small, cheap sensors.  At least for starters we'll be using the DS18B20 temperature sensor.

Other kinds of temp sensors, or sensors for other things may be added in the future.
